  <b> â€¢Research Question & Research Gap</b>
</div>

<div>
Research question: How does virtual water flow between countries, and how can we use social network analysis (SNA) to understand the global structure of this flow?
</div>

<div>
Research Gap: Most past research focused only on agricultural products and didnâ€™t explore the whole-industry level or apply SNA to network characteristics.

```python
import networkx as nx
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
G = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(df, source="source", target="target")
```
