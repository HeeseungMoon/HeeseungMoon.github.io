  <b>1. Summary of the reading</b>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- Based on the characteristics of the Korean steel industry, this study empirically analyzes how cognitive, organizational, and geographic proximity affects the formation of technical knowledge networks. Considering not only the 'linear relationship' or 'inverted U-shaped' relationship presented in the existing literature, but also the possibility of other types of relationship, the influence of various proximity was examined in the unique environment of the Korean steel industry.

<div style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">
  <b> â€¢ Research Question & Research Gap</b>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- Research Question:
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- How do different types of proximity (cognitive, geographical, organizational) affect the formation of knowledge networks in the Korean steel industry?
</div>

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- Research Gap:
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- Most existing studies have focused on fast-growing industries in developed countries (e.g., bio, nano, electronics industries) and lack empirical studies on mature industries in developing countries.
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- The concept of organizational proximity is unclear and has not been sufficiently examined empirically.
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- Existing studies have considered only two patterns, linear or inverted U-shaped, but other relationship types, such as wave-like, have not been explored.
</div>

<br>

<div style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">
  <b> â€¢ Method</b>
</div>



<div style="text-align: center;">
- Data Collection: Using Co-patent data related to the Korean steel industry from 1988â€“2013 (a total of 1,332, 296 institutions)
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- Network Analysis: Using Logical Regression - Quadratic Assignment Procedure (LR-QAP) to analyze the probability of collaboration occurrence
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
-Independent variables:
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- Cognitive proximity: Cosine similarity
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- Geographical proximity: Euclidean
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- Organizational probability: 4 types (same group, equity relationship, non-equity relationship, indirect consolidation)
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- Control variables: Difference in number of patents, similarity in organizational form, etc
</div>

<br>

<div style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">
  <b> â€¢ Results + Interpretation</b>
</div>


<div style="text-align: center;">
- Key Results
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- Cognitive Prosperity: has a linear positive effect. Inverse U-shaped relationships are not statistically significant â†’ reflecting industrial characteristics centered on narrow technical areas
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- Geographic Proximity: increasing distance reduces the probability of cooperation (linear negative relationship). Influenced by large corporations' multi-regional strategies.
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- Organizational Proximity: Wave-like relationship identified:
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- Same group (ORG-Group): Strong positive effect
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- ORG-Equity: Effectiveness weakened (especially in 2004â€“13)
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- ORG-Nonequity: Increasing influence over time
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- ORG-Mediated: negative impact on the possibility of cooperation
</div>

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- Interpretation
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- The vertical and centralized structure of the Korean steel industry influences network formation.
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- The attempt to quantify the relationship between various types of organizations on a continuous scale is significant in that it goes beyond the existing dichotomous analysis.
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- Government policies need to focus on strengthening strategic alliances between large and small businesses and activating cooperative networks between small businesses in the surrounding areas.
</div>


<div style="font-size: 36px; text-align: center;">
  <b>2. Data introduction</b>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- This time I used the same data from last project in https://heeseungmoon.github.io/Penn_analysis/
</div>

<br>

<div style="font-size: 36px; text-align: center;">
  <b>3. Analysis</b>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- This analysis is a network analysis based on inter-county migration flows within Pennsylvania. Inter county migration data were extracted from 2016â€“2020 data from the U.S. Census, and weighted network graphs were constructed based on them.
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- I also applied the Multiple Regression Quadrant Allocation Procedure (MR-QAP) to analyze the factors affecting migration flows.
</div>

<br>

```python
independent_networks = [dist_mat, var_diff_mat]
```

```python
independent_networks2 = [dist_mat, white_diff_mat]
```

```python
independent_networks3 = [dist_mat, Black_diff_mat]
```

```python
independent_networks4 = [dist_mat, var_diff_mat, white_diff_mat,  Black_diff_mat]
```

```python
independent_networks5 = [dist_mat, var_diff_mat, white_diff_mat,  Black_diff_mat, degree_diff_mat]
```

<div style="text-align: center;">
- In this part, several analytical models were constructed by combining various factors (independent variables) that could affect migrant networks (dependent variables).
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- dist_mat: geographical distance between counties
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- var_diff_mat: median income difference
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- white_diff_mat: white people ratio difference
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- Black_diff_mat: black people ratio difference
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- degree_diff_mat: education levels difference.
</div>

<br>

```python
betas, p_values, r_2, r_2_p = mrqap_analysis(dependent_network, independent_networks)

print("MRQAP results:")
print(f"R^2: {r_2:.4f}")
print(f"R^2 based on permutation: {r_2_p.mean():.4f}")
print("-" * 20)
for i, beta in enumerate(betas):
    print(f"Independent var {i+1}'s coeff (Beta): {beta:.4f}")
    print(f"Independent var {i+1}'s p-value: {p_values[i]:.4f}")
    print("-" * 20)
```

<br>

```python
plt.hist(r_2_p, bins=30, alpha=0.7, label="Permuted RÂ²")
plt.axvline(r_2, color='red', linestyle='--', label="Observed RÂ²")
plt.xlabel("RÂ² Value")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Permutation Distribution of RÂ²")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

![network1](/assets/images/network1.png)

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- As a result of MR-QAP analysis using distance and white population ratio differences as independent variables, the explanatory power of the entire model was low at RÂ² = -0.0062, and there was no statistically significant difference with the permutation-based distribution.
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- However, in variable units, the difference in the **white population proportion (p = 0.0070)** showed statistically significant influence, suggesting that similarities/differences in race composition may influence migration decisions.
</div>

<br>

```python
betas, p_values, r_2, r_2_p = mrqap_analysis(dependent_network, independent_networks2)

print("MRQAP results:")
print(f"R^2: {r_2:.4f}")
print(f"R^2 based on permutation: {r_2_p.mean():.4f}")
print("-" * 20)
for i, beta in enumerate(betas):
    print(f"Independent var {i+1}'s coeff (Beta): {beta:.4f}")
    print(f"Independent var {i+1}'s p-value: {p_values[i]:.4f}")
    print("-" * 20)
```

<br>

```python
plt.hist(r_2_p, bins=30, alpha=0.7, label="Permuted RÂ²")
plt.axvline(r_22, color='red', linestyle='--', label="Observed RÂ²")
plt.xlabel("RÂ² Value")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Permutation Distribution of RÂ²")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

![network22](/assets/images/network22.png)

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- MR-QAP analysis with distance and white population ratio differences as independent variables showed that the explanatory power of the entire model was low, showing no significant difference from the random model.
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- However, the white population composition difference variable showed significant results at the p < 0.01 level, suggesting that racial similarities may influence interregional migration decisions.
</div>

<br>

```python
betas, p_values, r_2, r_2_p = mrqap_analysis(dependent_network, independent_networks3)

print("MRQAP results:")
print(f"R^2: {r_2:.4f}")
print(f"R^2 based on permutation: {r_2_p.mean():.4f}")
print("-" * 20)
for i, beta in enumerate(betas):
    print(f"Independent var {i+1}'s coeff (Beta): {beta:.4f}")
    print(f"Independent var {i+1}'s p-value: {p_values[i]:.4f}")
    print("-" * 20)
```

<br>

```python
plt.hist(r_2_p, bins=30, alpha=0.7, label="Permuted RÂ²")
plt.axvline(r_22, color='red', linestyle='--', label="Observed RÂ²")
plt.xlabel("RÂ² Value")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Permutation Distribution of RÂ²")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

![network3](/assets/images/network3.png)

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- MR-QAP analysis including differences in distance and Black population ratio showed that the explanatory power of the model (RÂ² = 0.0240) was significantly higher than the permutation-based distribution, suggesting that it was a statistically significant model overall.
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- In particular, the difference in the proportion of the black population was found to be a significant variable at the level of p = 0.001, suggesting that heterogeneity in ethnic composition may be a factor influencing the flow of migration between regions. On the other hand, distance variables did not contribute to explanatory power in this analysis.
</div>

<br>

```python
betas, p_values, r_2, r_2_p = mrqap_analysis(dependent_network, independent_networks4)

print("MRQAP results:")
print(f"R^2: {r_2:.4f}")
print(f"R^2 based on permutation: {r_2_p.mean():.4f}")
print("-" * 20)
for i, beta in enumerate(betas):
    print(f"Independent var {i+1}'s coeff (Beta): {beta:.4f}")
    print(f"Independent var {i+1}'s p-value: {p_values[i]:.4f}")
    print("-" * 20)
```
<br>

```python
plt.hist(r_2_p, bins=30, alpha=0.7, label="Permuted RÂ²")
plt.axvline(r_22, color='red', linestyle='--', label="Observed RÂ²")
plt.xlabel("RÂ² Value")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Permutation Distribution of RÂ²")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

![network4](/assets/images/network4.png)

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- The comprehensive model (independent_networks4) including distance, income, and race differences was RÂ² = 0.0552, showing higher explanatory power compared to previous models.
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- Compared to the permutation distribution, the observed RÂ² is located on the right tail, confirming that the model has more explanatory power than chance and is statistically significant.
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- In particular, the difference in income (p = 0.0010) and the difference in the proportion of black people (p = 0.0010) were found to be variables that significantly affected the migration flow.
</div>

<br>

```python
betas, p_values, r_2, r_2_p = mrqap_analysis(dependent_network, independent_networks5)

print("MRQAP results:")
print(f"R^2: {r_2:.4f}")
print(f"R^2 based on permutation: {r_2_p.mean():.4f}")
print("-" * 20)
for i, beta in enumerate(betas):
    print(f"Independent var {i+1}'s coeff (Beta): {beta:.4f}")
    print(f"Independent var {i+1}'s p-value: {p_values[i]:.4f}")
    print("-" * 20)
```

<br>

```python
plt.hist(r_2_p, bins=30, alpha=0.7, label="Permuted RÂ²")
plt.axvline(r_22, color='red', linestyle='--', label="Observed RÂ²")
plt.xlabel("RÂ² Value")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Permutation Distribution of RÂ²")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

![network5](/assets/images/network5.png)

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- In the comprehensive model (independent_networks5) that considers distance, economy, race, and education gaps, RÂ² = 0.0841, showing high explanatory power significantly exceeding the permutation distribution.
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- In particular, income differences, black/white ratio differences, and degree differences all showed significant effects at the p < 0.05 level, suggesting that socioeconomic disparities play an important role in migration decisions.
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
- On the other hand, the distance difference still did not significantly affect the explanatory power.
</div>
